# mobius-strip
3D Möbius Strip visualizer and analyzer built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Calculates surface area and edge length.

# Möbius Strip Visualizer 🌀

This project is a Python-based 3D Möbius strip visualizer and analyzer using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**. It not only renders the Möbius strip in 3D but also calculates its **surface area** and **edge length** using numerical methods.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Generates a 3D Möbius strip mesh
- Calculates surface area using partial derivatives and vector cross products
- Computes the edge length of the strip
- Visualizes the shape interactively with Matplotlib

---

## 💡 Why This Project is Useful

This project is useful for:
- **Students** and **educators** studying 3D geometry and topology
- Those interested in **visual math**, **numerical methods**, or **Python graphics**
- Anyone who wants a clean example of **parametric surface modeling**
